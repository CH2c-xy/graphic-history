        <p class="text">
          Named after its printer, Johannes Gutenberg, the Gutenberg Bible is
          the first work to be printed with movable type. The book marks a
          significant point in graphic design history as it represents the
          beginning of mass-printing.

        <h2>Arts and Crafts 1880 – 1910</h2>
        <p class="text">
          The Arts and Crafts movement developed in opposition to the
          mass-produced design following the Industrial Revolution. Being a
          philosophy as much as a design style, the idea was to return to the
          quality and personality of hand crafted items. William Morris was at
          the forefront of the movement and believed in surrounding oneself with
          good design that was both functional and beautiful.

        <p class="text">
          Similar to the Arts and Crafts movement which took place during the
          same time, Art Nouveau is characterized by organic lines and
          ornamental flourishes. Designs often portrayed elements of nature and
          female figures. Alphonse Mucha is one of the most notable names from
          this period.

        <h2>Expressionism 1905 – 1933</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Expressionists sought to portray emotion at the cost of realism. Forms
          were dramatized and distorted, heavy strokes, shadows and bold colors
          were common. Part of what made Expressionism successful was the
          emotion it evoked in its viewers, making the art more memorable.

        <p class="text">
          Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque are two of the artists most known for
          establishing the Cubist art style. Coined after a comment on one of
          Braques works as composed of cubes, Cubism features scenes and figures
          abstracted into shapes. This rejection of traditional perspective for
          a more fragmented depiction of reality continues to influence art and
          design.

        <p class="text">
          Futurism, having its origin in Italy, strove to embrace concepts such
          as innovation, speed, violence, and youth. Recurring motifs as cars,
          people and animals in motion, illustrated the dynamism that the
          movement was about &mdash; rejecting the past and moving towards the
          future.

        <p class="text">
          Those who adhered to Dadaism held to the belief that all things were
          devoid of real meaning. This philosophy extended to art, literature,
          music, and film. As an art movement it favored the style of montage
          and elements placed seemingly at random.

        <p class="text">
          Constructivism began in Russia at the onset of Communism and propelled
          the idea of constructing art into something that could be manufactured
          for the benefit of society. Other artists and designers, however,
          continued with a more abstract and analytical style inspired by Cubism
          and Futurism.

          "Form follows function" is the central principle taught by this German
          design school. Building off of previous movements, the style that
          developed during its existence often consisted of geometric shapes
          combined with fine art. Bauhaus has impacted the graphic design
          industry significantly and its principles are still taught today.

          Beginning in Paris, Art Déco flourished between the two World Wars and

          Also known as International Typographic Style, the movement originated
          in Switzerland and quickly became popularized. Its designs were often
          based on a grid system with simple and asymmetrical layouts featuring
          sans-serif typefaces. Josef Müller-Brockmann is well-known for his
          distinct Swiss style posters.

        <p class="text">
          The Creative Revolution, as it was later titled, was a breakthrough in
          advertising. Companies promoted their brand through self-deprecating
          humor or irony to appeal to its younger consumers, pairing catchy
          phrases with images that emphasized its selling point. Graphic design
          was a tool in forming these creative campaigns.

        <h2>Pop Art 1955 – 1980</h2>
        <p class="text">
          The Pop Art movement brought everyday objects from popular culture,
          especially American, into the realm of art and design. It celebrated
          the ordinary in contrast to elitist art, and objects such as packaging
          and advertisement became the center point of imagery. Campbell's soup
          and vivid comic book inspired portraits are iconic motifs from this
          period.

        <p class="text">
          Influenced by the vividness of Pop Art and the prevalence of
          hallucinatory drugs, the style features striking colors and abstract
          swirls of lines and type. Elements of Art Nouveau are often seen in
          works from this time, many of which were posters made to promote music
          shows and festivals.

        <h2>Postmodernism 1970 – 2000</h2>
        <p class="text">
          A shift in ideology to believing in a subjective reality rather than
          objective led to a more controversial approach to design that
          challenged previous systems. Both Punk and digital design belong to
          this broad movement and it is debated whether the postmodern era has
          truly ended.
