      <p class="text">Named after its printer, Johannes Gutenberg, the Gutenberg Bible is the first work to be
        printed
        with movable type. The book marks a significant point in graphic design history as it represents the beginning
        of
        mass-printing.</p>

      <h2>Arts and Crafts 1880 – 1910</h2>
      <p class="text">The Arts and Crafts movement developed in opposition to the mass-produced design following the
        Industrial Revolution. Being a philosophy as much as a design style, the idea was to return to the quality
        and
        personality of hand crafted items. William Morris was at the forefront of the movement and believed in
        surrounding oneself with good design that was both functional and beautiful.</p>

      <h2>Art Nouveau 1890 – 1910</h2>
      <p class="text">Similar to the Arts and Crafts movement which took place during the same time, Art Nouveau is
        characterized by organic lines and ornamental flourishes. Designs often portrayed elements of nature and
        female
        figures. Alphonse Mucha is one of the most notable names from this period.</p>

      <h2>Expressionism 1905 – 1933</h2>
      <p class="text">Expressionists sought to portray emotion at the cost of realism. Forms were dramatized and
        distorted, heavy strokes, shadows and bold colors were common. Part of what made Expressionism successful
        was
        the emotion it evoked in its viewers, making the art more memorable.</p>

      <h2>Cubism 1907 – 1914</h2>
      <p class="text">Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque are two of the artists most known for establishing the Cubist
        art
        style. Coined after a comment on one of Braques works as composed of cubes, Cubism features scenes and
        figures
        abstracted into shapes. This rejection of traditional perspective for a more fragmented depiction of reality
        continues to influence art and design.</p>

      <h2>Futurism 1909 – 1916</h2>
      <p class="text">Futurism, having its origin in Italy, strove to embrace concepts such as innovation, speed,
        violence, and youth. Recurring motifs as cars, people and animals in motion, illustrated the dynamism that
        the
        movement was about &mdash; rejecting the past and moving towards the future.</p>

      <h2>Dadaism 1916 – 1923</h2>
      <p class="text">Those who adhered to Dadaism held to the belief that all things were devoid of real meaning.
        This
        philosophy extended to art, literature, music, and film. As an art movement it favored the style of montage and
        elements
        placed seemingly at random.</p>

      <h2>Constructivism 1919 – 1930</h2>
      <p class="text">Constructivism began in Russia at the onset of Communism and propelled the idea of
        constructing
        art into something that could be manufactured for the benefit of society. Other artists and designers,
        however,
        continued with a more abstract and analytical style inspired by Cubism and Futurism.</p>

      <p class="text">"Form follows function" is the central principle taught by this German design school. Building
        off
        of previous movements, the style that developed during its existence often consisted of geometric shapes
        combined with fine art. Bauhaus has impacted the graphic design industry significantly and its principles
        are
        still taught today.</p>

        areas
        of design.</p>

      <h2>Swiss Style 1950s</h2>
      <p class="text">Also known as International Typographic Style, the movement originated in Switzerland and
        quickly
        became popularized. Its designs were often based on a grid system with simple and asymmetrical layouts
        featuring
        sans-serif typefaces. Josef Müller-Brockmann is well-known for his distinct Swiss style posters.</p>

      <h2>The Creative Revolution 1950 – 1970</h2>
      <p class="text">The Creative Revolution, as it was later titled, was a breakthrough in advertising. Companies
        promoted their brand through self-deprecating humor or irony to appeal to its younger consumers, pairing
        catchy
        phrases with images that emphasized its selling point. Graphic design was a tool in forming these creative
        campaigns.</p>

      <h2>Pop Art 1955 – 1980</h2>
      <p class="text">The Pop Art movement brought everyday objects from popular culture, especially American, into
        the
        realm of art and design. It celebrated the ordinary in contrast to elitist art, and objects such as
        packaging
        and advertisement became the center point of imagery. Campbell's soup and vivid comic book inspired
        portraits
        are iconic motifs from this period.</p>

      <p class="text">Influenced by the vividness of Pop Art and the prevalence of hallucinatory drugs, the style
        features striking colors and abstract swirls of lines and type. Elements of Art Nouveau are often seen in works
        from this time, many of which were posters made to promote music shows and festivals.</p>

      <h2>Postmodernism 1970 – 2000</h2>
      <p class="text">A shift in ideology to believing in a subjective reality rather than objective led to a more
        controversial approach to design that challenged previous systems. Both Punk and digital design belong to
        this
        broad movement and it is debated whether the postmodern era has truly ended.</p>
